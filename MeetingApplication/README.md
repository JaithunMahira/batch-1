# Meeting Application API

Backend API written in Node.js (using Express.js) for a Meeting Application with RESTful endpoints. It utilizes local mongodb database to read/write/store data and can also be easily used with cloud mongodb atlas.

## Setup

   - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
   - [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the dependencies.

3. Run `npm run build` or `yarn build` once to let babel build the application on ./lib/.

## Usage

Run `npm run start` or `yarn start` after building to run the application on localhost:4000 (default).
